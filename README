# Python Project README

This repository contains a Python project that utilizes the Google Sheets API to work with a specific Google Sheets document. To set up and run the project, follow the steps outlined below:

## Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Setting Up the Project

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**: It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies for this project. Open a terminal and run the following command to create a new virtual environment named "venv":

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**: Activate the virtual environment:

    - **On Windows**:
    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

    - **On Unix or MacOS**:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the project dependencies using pip and the provided `requirements.txt`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Get Google Sheets API Key**:
   
   Obtain a Google Sheets API key by following the instructions provided by Google for the Google Sheets API. Save the API key as `service_account.json` and place it in the `~/.config/gspread/` directory.

## Configure the Project

1. **Copy the Google Sheets Document**:

    Make a copy of the Google Sheets document available at the following URL and access it via your Google account:
    [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j_CulCc3jxLVv-pTeYnyd35H6sFlLlAJa9wIrr5XHMs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j_CulCc3jxLVv-pTeYnyd35H6sFlLlAJa9wIrr5XHMs)

2. **Update the Sheets URL Parameter**:

    Open the `main.py` file and locate the `sheets_url` parameter. Update the value of `sheets_url` with the new Google Sheets document URL you copied in the previous step.

## Running the Project

1. **Run the Python Script**:

    In the activated virtual environment, run the main Python script using the following command:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    This will execute the script and perform the desired actions using the Google Sheets API.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions and access to the Google Sheets document and the Google Sheets API for the desired operations to be successful.
- For any issues or inquiries related to the project, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers or contributors.
